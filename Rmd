##Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

##Data
The training data for this project are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

##Reproducibility

Libraries Needed and Seed for pseudo-random generator

```{r, echo= TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart) 
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(lattice)
set.seed(12345)
```

##Data Importing into R

Setting train and testing datasets’ urls:

```{r, echo= TRUE}
urlTrain <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
urlTest <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
```

File retrieval and reading:

```{r, echo= TRUE}
csvTrain <- "pml-training.csv"

if (file.exists(csvTrain)) {
        train <- read.csv(csvTrain, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
} else { 
        download.file(urlTrain,csvTrain)
        train <- read.csv(csvTrain, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
        }                           

csvTest <-  "pml-testing.csv"

if (file.exists(csvTest)) {
        test <- read.csv(csvTest, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
} else { 
        download.file(urlTest,csvTest)
        test <- read.csv(csvTest, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
}
```

##Training-Set cleaning and pre-processing

Names’s Coherence Check

```{r}
all.equal(colnames(test)[1:length(colnames(test))-1], colnames(train)[1:length(colnames(train))-1])
```

```{r, echo= TRUE, eval= FALSE}
summary(train)
summary(test)
```

The summary output is hidden due to the size of the dataset, here it is reported the code to allow reproduction.

To ease the computation and due to the low informativity loss, the dataset is cleaned from the variables with an high share of NAs and from the ones characterized by low variance.

```{r, echo= TRUE, eval=FALSE}
nearzero <- nearZeroVar(train, saveMetrics = TRUE)
train <- train[, !nearzero$nzv]
```

Variables with more than 50% missing values are removed

```{r, echo= TRUE}
toberem <- sapply(colnames(train), function(x) if(sum(is.na(train[, x])) > 0.50*nrow(train)){return(TRUE)}else{return(FALSE)})
train <- train[, !toberem]
```

Variables related with data acquisition (like: id, timestamps, individuals’ names, etc.) are not suitable to be used in prediction and are removed

```{r, echo= TRUE}
train <- train[, -(1:6)]
```

Correlation analysis:

```{r, echo= TRUE}
Hcorr <- caret::findCorrelation(cor(train[, -53]), cutoff= 0.8)
names(train)[Hcorr]
```

Many variables are highly correlated. PCA will be used in the pre-processing. After the data cleaning the variables selected to specify the model are:

```{r, echo= TRUE}
names(train)
```

##Model Specification and Cross Validation
In order to avoid overfitting and to reduce out of sample errors, TrainControl is used to perform 7-fold cross validation.

```{r, echo= TRUE}
tc <- trainControl(method = "cv", number= 7, verboseIter= FALSE, 
                   preProcOptions= "pca", allowParallel=TRUE)
```

Six models are estimated: Random forest, Support Vector Machine (both radial and linear), a Neural net, a Bayes Generalized linear model and a Logit Boosted model.

```{r, echo= TRUE}
rf <- train(classe ~ ., data = train, method = "rf", trControl= tc)
svmr <- train(classe ~ ., data = train, method = "svmRadial", trControl= tc)
NN <- train(classe ~ ., data = train, method = "nnet", trControl= tc, verbose=FALSE)
```

```{r, echo= TRUE}
svml <- train(classe ~ ., data = train, method = "svmLinear", trControl= tc)
bayesglm <- train(classe ~ ., data = train, method = "bayesglm", trControl= tc)
logitboost <- train(classe ~ ., data = train, method = "LogitBoost", trControl= tc)
```

Accuracy comparision

```{r, echo= TRUE}
model <- c("Random Forest", "SVM (radial)","LogitBoost","SVM (linear)","Neural Net", "Bayes GLM")
Accuracy <- c(max(rf$results$Accuracy),
        max(svmr$results$Accuracy),
        max(logitboost$results$Accuracy),
        max(svml$results$Accuracy),
        max(NN$results$Accuracy),
        max(bayesglm$results$Accuracy))
        
Kappa <- c(max(rf$results$Kappa),
        max(svmr$results$Kappa),
        max(logitboost$results$Kappa),
        max(svml$results$Kappa),
        max(NN$results$Kappa),
        max(bayesglm$results$Kappa))  

performance <- cbind(model,Accuracy,Kappa)
```

```{r, echo= TRUE}
knitr::kable(performance)
```

Random forest and SVM(radial) provide the best results and will provide the predictions for the submission. Even if the Out of sample error cannot be estimated exactly, the in-sample error obtained through cross-validation is calculated over different test sets and should provide a better estimate of out-of sample error with respect to the case of no cross-validation.

Prediction of “classe” variable for the test set

```{r, echo= TRUE}
rfPred <- predict(rf, test)
svmrPred <- predict(svmr, test)
```

Checking if the models give same predictions

```{r, echo= TRUE}
prediction <- data.frame(cbind(rfPred, svmrPred))
prediction$same <- with(prediction, rfPred == svmrPred)
colnames(prediction) <- c("Random Forest", "SVM (radial)", "Same Prediction")
```

```{r, echo= TRUE}
knitr::kable(prediction)
```

Generation of the files to be submitted is made through the provided function

```{r, echo= TRUE}
pml_write_files = function(x){
        n = length(x)
        for(i in 1:n){
                filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
                write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
        }
}

pml_write_files(rfPred)
pml_write_files(svmrPred)
```

##Conclusions

The random forest model provides an outstanding accuracy and, accordingly, the predictions for the test set were correct in 100% of the cases.
